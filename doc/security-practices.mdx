# Security Practices

## 1. Data Encryption
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive communications
- AES-256 encryption for data at rest
- TLS 1.3 for all data in transit

## 2. Access Controls
- Role-based access control (RBAC) system
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) enforcement
- Regular access reviews and permission audits

## 3. Infrastructure Security
- Cloud infrastructure with built-in DDoS protection
- Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing
- Isolated environments for production and development

## 4. Secure Development
- Code reviews and static analysis for all changes
- Dependency scanning for known vulnerabilities
- Automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline

## 5. Incident Response
- 24/7 security monitoring
- Breach notification within 72 hours of discovery
- Dedicated incident response team
